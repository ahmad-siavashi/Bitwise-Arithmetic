# Bitwise Arithmetic
bitwiseArithmetic.hpp is a header-only library to perform addition and multiplication (booth's algorithm) in a bitwise manner.
I wrote these two functions to simulate hardware operations and study the impact of using approximate adders (adders which does not work correctly for some inputs in favor of using less power or consuming less resources e.g. silicon area).
